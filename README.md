# UAV-practice
A class from ZJU
The controller_sim is for UAV position simulator and real_ws is used on real robotics.
The hw_min_snap_full is for UAV tracking the trajectory optimized by minimun-snap method.
linear_control.cpp linear_control_correct.cpp and min_snap_closeform.cpp is all the correct answer we should to fill in the blanks.
The sources file is some learning files during the five days.


All the simulations are tested in ubuntu18.04,but due to the motion capture environment in our laboratory is different from ZJU,we don't tested our own UAV after the class.
In the end,hoping you guys can make project that can convert vicon_bridge to vrpn_client,it can help us do testing in our own environment.I will be very appreciate for you!
